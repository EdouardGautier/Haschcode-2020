Competition organised by Google in 2020. The objective is to answer a given problem, on the theme of data processing.
The script is made in Python V3. No external library is needed.
The results are calculated and displayed directly in the terminal. The files to be processed are [here](Output).

## [Issue 📘📕📗](hashcode_2020_online_qualification_round.pdf)
Books allow us to discover fantasy worlds and better understand the world we live in.
They enable us to learn about everything from photography to compilers… and of course a good book is a great way to relax!

Last 15 years, Google Books has collected digital copies of 40 million books i n more
than 400 languages.

In this competition problem, we will explore the challenges of seing up a scanning
process for millions of books stored i n l ibraries around the world and having them scanned at a scanning facility.

### Objectives ✔️
Given a description of libraries and books available, plan which books to scan from which library to maximize the total score of all scanned books, taking into account that each library needs to be signed up before it can ship books.

### Score Calculation 🏅
Your score is the sum of the scores of all books that are scanned within **D** days. 
Note that if the same book is shipped from multiple libraries, the solution will be accepted but the score for the book will be awarded only once.

## Solution 🔨
### Principle 📘
It is important to have read [the instructions for the competition](hashcode_2020_online_qualification_round.pdf) beforehand, to understand the rest.

The ratio of library, number of days borrowed / total book score, is calculated. This allows us to sort them.

We start with the library with the highest ratio, on day 0, we add the signup process time.
We start to return the books, starting with the books with the highest score. And those that we still have books or days left to return.

Once this library is finished, we recalculate all the ratios of all the librarys. This makes it possible to delete the books that have already been rendered. This way we always treat the library that yields the most points.

We do the same treatment as for the first library, but the day after the signup process of the previous library. 
We continue in this way while we still have time to do the signup process of at least one library.

### [Score 🏆](images/Score.png)
This is calculated directly by the script.

File | Number of libairys | Number of books | Number of days | Score | Time 
------------ | ------------- | ------------ | ------------- | ------------ | ------------ |
a_example.txt | 6 | 2 | 7 | 21 | 00h 00min 00s
b_read_on.txt | 100 000 | 100 | 1 000 | 5 822 900 | 00h 03min 09s
c_incunabula.txt | 100 000 | 10 000 | 100 000 | 5 689 822 | 00h 02min 39s
d_tough_choices.txt | 78 600 | 30 000 | 30 001 | 5 028 010 | 00h 24min 39s
e_so_many_books.txt | 100 000 | 1 000 | 200 | 4 593 379 | 00h 02min 43s
f_libraries_of_the_world.txt | 100 000 | 1 000 | 700 | 5 208 176 | 00h 01min 25s
**Total** | **478 606** | **42 102** | **131 908** | **26 342 308** | **00h 34min 38s**

The calculated score is confirmed by the [Judge System of the HashCode](images/Score_google.png).
